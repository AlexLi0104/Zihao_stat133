###Quadratic Equation   

#####The general form of the quadratic equation is the following:
\begin{equation*}
  ax^2 + bx + c = d
\end{equation*}

where $a,b,c,d$ are real numbers.

Geometrically, this equation results in a parabola in the plane, which can be used to describe various motions of physical objects. The roots of the quadratic equation is of the following form:

\begin{equation*}
  x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation*}

###Comments and Reflections

#####What things were hard, even though you saw them in class?
I think things that I've seen in class are fairly easy in general, but installing packages caused me some trouble at first.

#####What was easy(-ish) even though we haven't done it in class?
Writing LaTeX is easy since I'm already familiar with the syntax. Also, RStudio allows me to directly write LaTeX commands without changing the environment in some ways, which is pretty cool and surprising.

#####Was this the first time you were using markdown? If yes, how do you feel about it?
Yes. This is the first time that I use Markdown syntax, and I feel pretty good about it. In general, it is easier than LaTeX syntax. Something that I do not like is the way to change the font size of the header, since keep addting "#" is not quite efficient. I wonder if there's any command that specifically assigns a font size.

#####Did you need help to complete the assignment? If so, what kind of help? Who helped you?
I finished this assignment on my own. When I ran into some problems of installing packages, I looked online and figured it out. In general this assignment is not hard.

#####How much time did it take to complete this HW?
I would say one to two hours, including the time that I learn Markdown syntax. 

#####What was the most time consuming part?
The writing itself is the most time consuming part, especially that I need to figure out the steps to make cookies.
