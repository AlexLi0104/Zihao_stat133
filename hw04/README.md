#### Comments and reflections

  - This is my first time writing unit tests.
  - I find it pretty confusing. Maybe 8. 
  - This is my first time working with ggvis.
  - Maybe 5.
  - This is my first time working with conditional panels.
  - Conditional panels themselves are not challenging. Maybe 3. 
  - I like ggplot. I think those are the most beautiful ones.
  - I looked on Piazza for similar issues.
  - I spent a lot of time.
  - The most time consuming part was writing functions.
