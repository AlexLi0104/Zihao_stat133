#### This assignment will explore two variables: "position" and "points."

``` r
load("nba2017-salary-points.RData")
```

The summary of the quantitaive variable "points" is give as the following:

``` r
summary(points)
```

    ##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
    ##     0.0   156.0   432.0   546.6   780.0  2558.0

The various statistics of the variable is given by:

``` r
mean(points)
```

    ## [1] 546.6054

``` r
sd(points)
```

    ## [1] 489.0156

``` r
min(points)
```

    ## [1] 0

``` r
max(points)
```

    ## [1] 2558

``` r
median(points)
```

    ## [1] 432

``` r
quantile(points, names = F)
```

    ## [1]    0  156  432  780 2558

``` r
spread <- max(points) - min(points)
spread
```

    ## [1] 2558

The distribution of the variable is given in the following graphs:

``` r
hist(points, main = paste("Histogram of Actual Frequency"))
```

``` r
hist(points, prob = T, main = paste("Histogram and Density Curve of Relative Frequency"))
lines(density(points))
```

``` r
boxplot(points, horizontal = T, range = 1.5)
```

The summary of the categorical variable "position" is give as the following:

``` r
factor(position)
```
